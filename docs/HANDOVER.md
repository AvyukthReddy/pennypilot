# Handover

Living snapshot of where PennyPilot stands right now. Read this first, every session.
Update it — don't append to it — as soon as state changes; this is a snapshot, not a log
(use [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) for history and rationale, [FLOW.md](FLOW.md) for
request-flow maps).

## Where things stand

- **Architecture split**: Next.js Server Actions handle auth only (Supabase); FastAPI
  (`backend/`) handles everything else. See [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md).
- **Auth**: Supabase Auth wired end-to-end — login, signup, logout, password reset,
  email confirm callback. Frontend proxy/middleware (`frontend/src/proxy.ts`,
  `lib/supabase/middleware.ts`) gates access; backend verifies Supabase JWTs
  (`backend/app/core/security.py`).
- **Profile**: `users` table (renamed from `profiles`, adds `created_at`, `updated_at`,
  `profile_image`) lives in Supabase Postgres, managed via SQLAlchemy + Alembic
  (`backend/app/models/user.py`, model class `User`). `GET/PUT /api/profile` exposed
  with CORS — route/schema names still say "profile" (`backend/app/schemas/profile.py`,
  `backend/app/api/profile.py`) since that's the settings-page contract, only the
  underlying table/model was renamed. Frontend account settings page
  (`frontend/src/app/settings/`) reads/writes it through the shared API service layer
  (`frontend/src/services/app.service.ts`, `hooks/use-api-request.ts`).
- **Avatar upload**: `POST /api/profile/image` (`backend/app/api/profile.py`) accepts a
  multipart file, validates type/size in `backend/app/services/storage.py`, and uploads
  to the Supabase Storage `avatars` bucket using the caller's own JWT (forwarded via
  `CurrentUser.token`) — Storage RLS enforces users can only write to their own
  `{user_id}/` folder, same trust model as Postgres RLS. Bucket + RLS policy
  (`avatars_owner_write`) were created directly via SQL against `storage.buckets` /
  `storage.objects` (not tracked by Alembic — that's Supabase-managed schema, see
  [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md)). Frontend UI is the avatar circle + "Change photo" in
  `frontend/src/components/profile-form.tsx`; files over 5MB are compressed client-side
  first (`frontend/src/lib/compress-image.ts`, canvas resize + JPEG re-encode) rather
  than rejected — the backend's 5MB check stays as a safety net for anyone hitting the
  API directly.
- **Worker**: `worker/` scaffolded (Celery) but no tasks implemented yet beyond the
  placeholder in `worker/worker/tasks.py`.
- **Shared**: `shared/` is empty — intended for cross-service Pydantic models/enums once
  a feature needs backend and worker to agree on a type.

## In progress

- Nothing currently in flight. Last completed unit of work: profile image upload
  (`POST /api/profile/image` + settings page UI), backed by a new Supabase Storage
  `avatars` bucket. Not yet verified in a live browser session — Chrome extension
  wasn't connected when this was built; verified via `tsc`/lint/pytest only.

## Known broken / rough edges

- Profile image upload (`POST /api/profile/image`) hasn't been exercised against a real
  logged-in browser session yet — only unit-tested (auth mocked, `upload_avatar`
  monkeypatched). Worth a manual pass through the settings page before considering it
  done.

## What to avoid

- Don't put business logic in Next.js Server Actions — auth only. Everything else goes
  through FastAPI. (See [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) for why.)
- Don't assume Next.js APIs match training data — this repo is on Next.js 16 with
  breaking changes; check `frontend/node_modules/next/dist/docs/` first.

## Next up

- Not yet decided — check with the user before picking the next feature.
